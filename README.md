It use the **latest tools and techniques** to build an app that is scalable and maintainable, to the latest standards 
in Android development. Including:

towards this development pattern
- **MVVM architecture** is a standard in all well designed apps
- **Kotlin Coroutines** and **Flows**  are extremely useful and recommended by Google to run functionality 
on the background thread
- **Jetpack navigation** for moving around in the app
- **Retrofit** for network communications is a standard for all apps that talk to a backend API
- **Hilt Dependency Injection** has become a standard library that decouples object creation from use
- **Room database**  is essential for storing data in the app long term
